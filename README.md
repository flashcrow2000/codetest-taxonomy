# Littledata coding test

One challenge we have at Littledata is to categorise our client's websites by industry sector, so we can compare them with websites from the same industry.

The app we want you to build, using your chosen Javascript framework (angular / react / meteor) and Node backend has one user story:

* As a public user I can submit a URL and get back a top level category for that website

You can use the Watson Natual Language Understanding API to return a category: https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-understanding/api/v1/#categories

We are looking for well structured and commented code, and in the 2nd interview we will ask why you made certain design choices.

As a bonus, you should write tests for the API endpoint.

Some example websites you may want to test with:

http://shop.panthers.com

http://www.radisson.com

http://www.hobby-lobby.com

http://www.enjoylifefoods.com

http://www.josephturner.co.uk

http://www.bedandbreakfast.com
